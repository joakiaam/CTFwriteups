# My Solution
## Step 1
Looking at the image, we can see a screenshot taken from Google Maps. The car has clothes and sleeping bags on the roof and is in what looks like a rural area. According to geomastery (https://geomastery.com/google-car/), does this description fit for Mongolia?

## Step 2
The attached Google doc has a section for Mongolia and a document called *The Complete Guide to Mongolia* (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIA0vj9YYH-NseDSGXXSgmz9M65WkFPV5h5vF_WBQ2U/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.rki4i250pegy). 
There is a similar picture at page 110:

The location of that picture is marked on a map, where we can see it is close to a place called *Ulaanshiveet*.

## Step 3
I found the road by looking at Google Maps at different roads in the area.

## Step 4
The task specifies that we need to find a hotel/camp, and there was one camp close to the road named *Gobi Ranch tourist camp*.
